# CS300

	The problem the projects sought to solve was that of reading information from a file, categorizing, storing, and accessing that information. I approached the problem by first breaking it down into smaller pieces, and then utilizing the data structure that best fit in between the smaller pieces. Understanding different data structures helps in finding that best fit, in terms of speed, size, and efficiency. 
	Roadblocks were overcome by going back to the learning material and looking up different built-in functions on the C++ documentation site. This project expanded my approach to software design by providing me tools such as vectors and binary search trees. My work on this project has increased my ability to create modular code.
